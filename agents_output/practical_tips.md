## Practical Travel Tips for London

**Transportation:**

* **Oyster Card or contactless payment:** Purchase an Oyster card or use contactless payment (credit/debit cards) for easy and cost-effective travel on the London Underground (Tube), buses, and trams.  Avoid single-use tickets, which are more expensive.
* **The Tube (Underground):** London's extensive Tube network is the quickest way to travel across the city. Familiarize yourself with the Tube map before your trip.
* **Buses:** A more scenic (but slower) alternative to the Tube, buses cover a wide area. Consider using buses for shorter distances or to see more of the city.
* **Walking:** London is a walkable city, especially central areas.  Take advantage of this to explore different neighborhoods and discover hidden gems.
* **Black cabs:** Iconic, but expensive. Consider for longer distances or when luggage is involved.
* **Uber/Ride-sharing apps:** Convenient alternatives to black cabs, offering fare estimates in advance.

**Cultural Etiquette:**

* **Queueing:** Londoners value queuing (lining up). Be patient and respectful when waiting in line.
* **Public transport etiquette:** Give up your seat to the elderly, pregnant women, or disabled individuals. Avoid loud conversations on public transport.
* **Saying "please" and "thank you":** Using polite language goes a long way in London.
* **Tipping:**  Tipping is customary in restaurants (around 10-15%), bars, and taxis (round up the fare).
* **Personal space:** Maintain a reasonable distance from others in public spaces.

**Safety:**

* **Pickpocketing:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas. Keep valuables close and secure.
* **Scams:** Be wary of unsolicited approaches from strangers offering services or deals that seem too good to be true.
* **Emergency numbers:** Know the emergency numbers (999 for police, ambulance, or fire).
* **Street safety:** Stick to well-lit areas, especially at night.  Be aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts.

**Daily Budget Estimates (per person):**

* **Budget:** £50-£80  (This includes budget accommodation, affordable meals, and using public transport).
* **Mid-range:** £100-£150 (This allows for more comfortable accommodation, restaurant meals, and occasional taxis).
* **Luxury:** £200+ (This covers high-end accommodation, fine dining, and private transportation).

**Note:**  These are estimates and can vary greatly based on your travel style and choices.  Prices are generally higher in central London. Remember to factor in costs for attractions, activities, and souvenirs.
